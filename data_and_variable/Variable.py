Notes:
--> no need to declare data type as in c++/java [E.g. s = "Ahmed"]
--> print(type(s)) => outputs data type of s
--> # is uses for commenting
--> del(s) => clears the variable s and frees memory
"""

# E.g.
s = "Rahim"
print(s) 
# Output: Rahim

print(type(s)) 
# Output: <class 'str'>

del(s)
# deletes s variable from RAM
